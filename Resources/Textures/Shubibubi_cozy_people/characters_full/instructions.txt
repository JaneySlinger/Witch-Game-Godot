ANIMATIONS

Not all frames should be displayed at the same frame rate. This is because movements have anticipation, for example right before a jump
your character will anticipate for the jump, and also spend a little bit more time at the highest point of the jump. You might want to adjust the frame rate based on 
how fast your character moves/ how far jumps etc. The included gifs have the following frame rates:

Carry 	FR: all 100
Die 	FR: all 300
Jump 	FR: 100, 200,100, 120, 100
Pickaxe 	FR: 100, 100, 250, 60, 100
Walk       	FR: all 100
Water 	FR: 200, 400
